                  <p>In the 1920's  8 major studios controlled all film creation, and it was impossible to make a movie without them.  In 1948 the Government ruled these studios were an illegal monopoly and brought an end to Hollywood's "Golden Age."</p>

                There was nothing Golden about this era; the films were mediocre, and artistic creativity was stifled. As technology progressed the biggest change to the film industry was yet to come.  The internet forever altered how films were created, discovered, and shared. Today is filmmaking's true Golden Age.  Today a small team set out to make sure history does not repeat; today we start a revolution, and invite you to be part of the journey towards creating the first virtual studio.              </div>

                  Hollywood studios have competition in ways they never could have imagined 10 years ago. Audiences are straying away from theatrical tent pole productions, in order to stay home and watch niche content online.  There are plenty of places to watch films, but nothing addressed the people who actually make those great films.  Filmzu gives access not only professionals, but also students, aspiring filmmakers and businesses to connect and collaborate on a film or video project that people want to actually watch.

                Call us dreamers, but we feel that every problem can be solved with technology. We worked with literally thousands of filmmakers to create the easiest and most technologically advanced matchmaking and collaboration platform.   Our Research and Development period went to lengths few would have, but creating value to filmmakers and their fans could not be compromised.
