<h1> FAQ </h1>
<br><br>
<b>What is Filmzu:</b>  Filmzu makes creating films and finding the right people to work with exciting and fun.  We wanted to find a way to inspire people who had been tossing around a great idea in their head to get out there and engage with other people to make it a reality. You all know that really excited feeling you get right before your favorite holiday, or the vacation you have been planning, and we think you should feel the same way about your next film.  This is one of the greatest times to be involved in filmmaking, with it never being cheaper and easier to make a film, it’s simply a matter of working with the right people. There is a growing number of incredibly talented number of people outside the studio system, and now you finally have the access to them.

<br><br><b>
How much does Filmzu Cost:</b> Filmzu is free and always will be.  We subscribe to Levy’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution">Hacker’s Creed</a> that access to computers—and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. We will have premium features in the future that users can elect to pay for, but they will be above and beyond the incredible value add the standard site offers.
<br><br><b>

Why Don’t I See Any Ads:</b>  Most of us aren’t like Don Draper and love ads, so that’s why we declined to take the revenue they offer to provide a better user experience.  In the future we may start to show ads, but we will make every effort to show ads that are relevant to the filmmaking industry.
<br><br><b>

Why did you guys make FIlmzu:</b> We are major cinephiles and love online video, turns out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI6CfKcMhjY">Michael Bolton</a> is too. We found it harder to find great niche content amongst the sea of cat videos, and seeing another remake of some super hero movie was not for us.  We really like seeing obscure shorts, music videos that a guy with 1 camera and a mic shot and edited, and a film that is so bizarre we are not sure what we just saw. The content producer/artist is the king (or Queen), we just wanted to make sure they know that, and have the support they need in a very segregated industry.
<br><br><b>

<br><br><b>

<br><br><b>

How many lines of code is Filmzu made up of:</b> 78,921 and counting...
<br><br><b>

When was Filmzu Established:</b> We were founded in September of 2012, on our kickoff retreat to Middle Earth, also know as New Zealand.
<br><br><b>

Who should join Filmzu:</b> Filmzu is meant for a wide range of people, from filmmakers, actors, film students, agents, investors, companies, managers, fans, and even your family can participate!
<br><br><b>

Who is a filmmaker:</b>   We do not like to constrain the title of a “filmmaker” solely to the people who produce and direct a film.  While we certainly do not aim to dilute the name of a filmmaker, but rather to bolster it up with all of the people who were a part of the process.  From the writers, actors, makeup artists, visual effects, sound engineers, composers, editors, production assistants, and everyone else who all had a hand in getting the film made-they are all filmmakers in a sense. 
<br><br><b>

Favorite Movie Line:</b>"Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get." Forest Gump
<br><br><b>

Will Filmzu offer crowdfunding:</b>  We think companies like Kickstarter and Indiegogo do a great job at helping people get money for their films, we have no interest in getting in the way of people that do great things for the film community. There are a lot more regulations than many people realize with Crowdfunding,  Gordon Gecko would not care, but the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/tmjobsact-crowdfundingintermediariesfaq.htm">SEC</a> would.
<br><br><b>

How can Filmzu help me get my film financed:</b> Treat Filmzu as a matchmaking service, and contact investors or businesses that might want to participate in your film. Not everyone will want to go out with you, but someone will.
<br><br><b>

Who owns the content on Filmzu:</b> The artist owns 100% of the content they produce, and we want to support the artist in any way we can.
<br><br><b>

What Scenario should I create a project:</b> You can create a project and add your team to an already completed film, one you are casting for, or a film in production or post.  The idea is to build your audience and engage them with updates, behind the scenes shots, bloopers, etc. so when you release your film, or create your next one there are people who will want to see it.
<br><br><b>

Why do you show events:</b> Events are the icing on the cake for anything, but have a lot value for promoters and fans. What if a person is new to a place and wants to see what is going on in the area tonight?  They can go on FIlmzu and see what is popular or what they might be interested based on the event, location, and time.  This is a way to take an online audience and convert them to offline fans.

<br><br><b>

Why can I upvote/down vote events:</b> Events are naturally viral, people want to go to popular events and we want people to strive to create great events that people can benefit going from.  Whether is it a premier, screening, workshop or casting call we want to ensure the community knows about your event and helps to promote it along with you.
<br><br><b>

How can Filmzu help me as a talent Agent or Manager:</b>  Finding emerging artists and new people to work with will certainly benefit the you.  Filmzu is also a fantastic tracking tool for in progress projects.  Agents can follow the project, see behind the scenes shots, look over the cast, and find the next great role for them to work in.  We wanted a way agents can be on a beach drinking Mojitos and find a person for their next project.
<br><br><b>

How can Filmzu help me as a business owner:</b> If you don’t use video on your website you are missing out.  Having a video on your website can convert up to 60% more customers to purchasing your product or service.  We came to the realization that there was really no good way to find talented filmmakers to produce a video for our business.  We tried the Craigslist route and got bombarded without a good way to search and filmmakers that would be good for our video.  With Filmzu you can easily sort through filmmakers in a central location and choose them based on their style and skill sets.
<br><br><b>

How can Filmzu help me as a Film Student?:</b>  Film school still has a lot of great value for some people, one of the biggest advantages is the networking.  The fact still remains that connecting with people is crucial to taking your new degree and maximizing your potential.  They might be in the same class, or the next university over, but starting that connection on Filmzu is a great place to start.
